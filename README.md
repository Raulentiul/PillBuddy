# PillBuddy

PillBuddy is an app developed in Visual Studio, coded in just two days, during the HackTM hackathon, 2023.

The app can be accesed by either a patient or a doctor. If the patient has to LogIn, he first has to Create an Account. Each user can see their profile, the doctor being able to see his patients and send them a SMS message, and the patiens to see his affections and treatments. Also, the user can change his email, password, phone number.
